"""
strings_en.py

This module contains English language strings used throughout the Leakware application's user interface.
It serves as a centralized location for managing and accessing English language resources.

Usage:
This module is typically imported and the strings dictionary is accessed to retrieve the appropriate
English string for use in the application's user interface. It serves as the default or base language
for the application, and other language modules (e.g., strings_de.py, strings_zh.py) can be created
to provide translations for different languages.
